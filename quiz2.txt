1) A charge, $+Q$, is placed inside a balloon and the balloon is inflated. As the radius of the balloon r increases the number of field lines going through the surface of the balloon:

a. increases proportional to $r^2$
b. increases proportional to $r$
c. stays the same
d. decreases as $1/r$


2) The electric flux $\Phi_E$ is equivalent dimensionally to which of the following?

a. $N \times m^2/C$
b. $N/C$
c. $N \times m^2/C^2$
d. $N/C^2$



3) A closed surface contains the following point charges: 6 C, 4 C, –2 C, –4 C. The electric flux coming out of the surface is:

a. 16 $C/\epsilon_0$
b. -16 $C/\epsilon_0$
c. 4 $C/\epsilon_0$
d. -4 $C/\epsilon_0$



4) A spherical surface surrounds a point charge it its center. If the charge is doubled and if the radius of the surface is also doubled, what happens to the electric flux $\Phi_E$ out of the surface and the magnitude $|\vec E|$ of the electric field at the surface as a result of these doublings? 

a. $\Phi _E$ and E do not change
b. $\Phi _E$ and E remains the same
c. $\Phi _E$ and E decreases
d. $\Phi _E$ and E increases

1) A fully charged parallel-plate capacitor remains connected to a battery while you slide a dielectric between the plates. Do the following quantities (a) increase, (b) decrease, or (c) stay the same? (i) $C$ (ii) $Q$ (iii) $\Delta V$ (iv) the energy stored in the capacitor. Explain your reasoning.

#### Image formation:

A **real image** is formed when all light rays pass through and diverge from the image point.

A **virtual image** is formed when most if not all of the light rays do not pass through the image point but only appear to diverge from that point

#### Magnification

$$M = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} = \frac{h'}{h}$$


### Ray Diagrams for Lenses

Three **principal rays** are used to visualize the image location and size:

1.  For a converging lens ray 1 is drawn parallel to the principal axis. After being refracted by the lens, this ray passes through the **focal point** on the back side of the lens. For diverging lenses this ray emerges directed away from the focal point on the front side of the lens.

2. For a converging lens ray 2 is drawn through the focal point on the front side of the lens (or as if coming from the focal point if $p < f$ ) and emerges from the lens parallel to the principal axis. For diverging lens ray 2 is drawn in the direction toward the focal point on the back side of the lens and emerges from the lens parallel to the principal axis

3. For both diverging and convergin lenses: Ray 3 is drawn through the center of the lens and continues in a straight line.

### The thin lens equation

$$ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{f} $$

where $p$ is the object location, $q$ is the image location and $f$ is the focal lenght. 

#### Magnification:

$$M = \frac{h'}{h} = -\frac{q}{p} $$

### Sign Conventions:

1. The focal length is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses.
2. The object distance is positive if the object is on the side of the lens from which the light is coming  otherwise, it is negative.
3. The image distance is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens from
where the light is coming; if it is on the same side, is negative. Equivalently,
the image distance is positive for a real image and negative for a virtual image.
4. The height of the image, is positive if the image is upright, and negative if the
image is inverted relative to the object. ( is always taken as upright and positive.)
